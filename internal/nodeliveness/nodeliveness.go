// Package nodeliveness gives kairon-node an independent, per-node
// coordination.k8s.io/v1 Lease it renews every reconcile tick -- a real
// "I am alive and reconciling" signal kaironctl fence can cross-check
// before trusting Kubernetes Node Ready alone.
//
// Without this, fence's only input is the Node Ready condition
// kairon-controller already derives (internal/controller/fencing.go) --
// a pure kubelet-health signal. That's the wrong single source of truth
// for a destructive operator action: kubelet can flap NotReady (a brief
// network blip, an apiserver hiccup) while kairon-node's own reconcile
// loop keeps running fine, in which case fencing would abandon a Machine
// that's still actively, correctly managed. This package doesn't replace
// Node Ready -- it gives fence a second, independent signal to refuse to
// proceed on when the two disagree (see internal/kaironctl's own use of
// IsFresh), rather than silently trusting the kubelet-only signal.
//
// Deliberately NOT internal/leaderelection reused directly: that package
// solves mutual exclusion (multiple kairon-controller replicas contending
// for one shared Lease, with acquire/takeover semantics). A per-node
// liveness Lease has no contention at all -- only node N's own kairon-node
// instance ever legitimately writes kairon-node-<N>'s Lease, so the
// takeover/HolderIdentity-mismatch handling leaderelection.Elector needs
// would be unused complexity here. This package is intentionally smaller:
// create-or-renew, no acquire/lose-leadership state machine.
