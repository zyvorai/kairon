// scheduled onto (Spec.NodeName). Exported, with JSON tags, because it
// backs two independent surfaces that must never drift apart from one
// another: kaironctl's `top nodes` (internal/kaironctl's cmdTop) and
// kairon-ui's Nodes dashboard page (internal/uiapi's GET
// /api/v1/nodes/usage) both call AggregateUsageByNode below rather than
// each keeping its own copy of this grouping/summing logic.

// dash(m.Spec.NodeName) rendering, so an unscheduled Machine's usage --
// if it somehow has any -- is never silently dropped nor attributed to a
// real node) and returns one NodeUsageAggregate per distinct node,
// sorted by node name for deterministic, diffable output (map iteration
// order is otherwise unspecified).
//
// A Machine with no ResourceUsage yet (never reported by its agent, or
// not yet scheduled) still counts toward Machines -- a caller asking
// "how many Machines are on this node" wants that answer regardless of
// whether usage stats have arrived -- but contributes zero to the
// CPU/memory sums: "not yet reported" and "using nothing" are
// indistinguishable from a summed total's point of view, and
// undercounting is the safer direction for a hotspot-spotting view than
// fabricating a number.
