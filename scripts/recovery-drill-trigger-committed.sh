# Trigger B (BEST-EFFORT, RACY -- not deterministic, unlike Trigger A in
# recovery-drill-trigger-not-committed.sh) for docs/runbook-recovery-drill.md.
#
# Forces the genuinely-ambiguous "destination secretly committed" case
# needed to drill ConfirmDestinationCommitted. Real mechanics (verified
# against source): internal/migration.NetworkAwareDestination.Commit
# (internal/migration/network.go) does two sequential, INDEPENDENT steps
# for a network-fabric-enabled migration:
#   1. d.Inner.Commit(...)        -- the adapter's destCommit handler,
#                                     which calls FluxVM's real
#                                     "/v1/migration/receivers/{id}/activate"
#                                     and logs "fluxvm: receiver activated"
#                                     (cmd/kairon-migration-adapter-fluxvm/
#                                     main.go's destCommit) -- THE GUEST IS
#                                     NOW RUNNING ON THE DESTINATION.
#   2. d.Flux.NetworkMigrationResume(...) -- a separate, local FluxVM API
#                                     call on the SAME host.
# If step 2 fails after step 1 already succeeded, migration.Server.commit's
# response is an error (session store never advances past "Prepared"), but
# the destination guest is genuinely live -- exactly what
# destinationSessionPhase=="Prepared" is NOT proof against (see
# docs/runbook-migration-failures.md's caveat).
#
# Both steps run back-to-back on the destination host with NO network hop
# between them -- there is no reliable window to inject a failure between
# them from outside that host. This script's approach (tail the adapter's
# journal for "receiver activated", then immediately try to make the next
# local FluxVM call fail) is a SUB-SECOND, UNMEASURED race. It may take
# several attempts, or may never land. That is the honest, documented
# limitation -- do not tune this into looking more reliable than it is.
#
# Usage:
#   recovery-drill-trigger-committed.sh DEST_USER@DEST_HOST MACHINE_NAME TARGET_NODE_NAME [--namespace=ns] [--attempts=5] [--timeout=900]

  # without patching the adapter is to briefly SIGSTOP the local FluxVM
  # process so its next request stalls past kairon-node's own migration
  # RPC timeout (internal/migration.NewClient defaults to 15s) --
  # then SIGCONT it back. If FluxVM has no single top-level process to
  # pause (e.g. it forks per-request), this attempt will simply miss the
