# Restore a backup made by scripts/backup-crds.sh into the current
# kubectl context's cluster. Read docs/runbook-backup-restore.md first --
# in particular, whether this gets you working VMs back (not just
# Kubernetes objects) depends entirely on whether the hosts/FluxVM
# runtimes named in the backup are still alive; this script has no way to
# check that for you.
#
# Usage: restore-crds.sh BACKUP.tar.gz [--yes]
#   Without --yes, prints what would be applied (kubectl apply --dry-run=client)
#   and exits without changing anything -- this is deliberately not the
#   default action given how easily a restore into the wrong cluster/
#   context could go wrong.
