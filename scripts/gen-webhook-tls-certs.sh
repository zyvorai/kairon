# Generates a self-signed serving certificate for kairon-controller's
# validating admission webhook (webhook.enabled, see docs/guides/
# machine-quotas.md's "Admission webhook" section and SECURITY.md), the one
# other TLS-gated feature in this chart (alongside migration.tlsSecretName/
# console.tls.secretName) that ships with no chart-minted certificate --
# unlike those, though, there was previously no generator script for this
# one at all, so an operator had to hand-roll their own cert to ever turn
# webhook.enabled on. Mirrors gen-migration-mtls-certs.sh's own structure
# and self-signed-CA approach.
#
# This is evaluation/self-service tooling, same disclaimer as the migration
# script: a throwaway CA with a short default validity, meant for getting a
# real webhook running quickly to try it out or in a lab -- a production
# deployment should issue this certificate from cert-manager (or your own
# real CA) instead, with proper rotation, not a cert this script prints
# once and forgets about.
#
# Unlike migration.tlsSecretName's peers (kairon-node instances addressed
# by Kubernetes node InternalIP, verified against a fixed DNS SAN --
# "kairon-node" by default), the admission webhook is called by the
# kube-apiserver itself, over a real Kubernetes Service DNS name -- this
# chart does not create that Service or the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
# that references it (see webhook.tlsSecretName's own doc comment in
# values.yaml: "this chart does not mint a serving certificate for you").
# You still need to create both yourself, with the Service's DNS name
# matching SERVICE_DNS_NAME below exactly (kube-apiserver does real
# hostname verification against whatever `spec.clientConfig.service` names
# in your ValidatingWebhookConfiguration).
#
# Usage:
#   gen-webhook-tls-certs.sh OUT_DIR [SERVICE_NAME] [NAMESPACE]
#
# Example (defaults match this chart's own release-name-free resource
# names, i.e. a Service you'd create as `kairon-controller-webhook` in
# kairon-system):
#   gen-webhook-tls-certs.sh ./webhook-certs
#   gen-webhook-tls-certs.sh ./webhook-certs kairon-controller-webhook kairon-system
#
# Produces, under OUT_DIR:
#   ca.pem  cert.pem  key.pem
#     -- the raw PEM files, if you'd rather build your own Secret manually
#   kairon-webhook-tls.secret.yaml
#     -- a ready-to-`kubectl apply -f` Secret (tls.crt/tls.key), in the
#        exact shape charts/kairon expects for webhook.tlsSecretName
#   ca-bundle.b64
#     -- the base64 value to paste into webhook.caBundle
#
# Requires: openssl (any version with -addext support, 1.1.1+), base64.
