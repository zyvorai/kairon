"""check_rbac_coverage.py -- cross-checks each in-cluster component's actual
internal/kube.Client method calls against the RBAC (ClusterRole/Role) grants
its own ServiceAccount holds in charts/kairon/templates/all.yaml.

Why this exists: two real, silent-in-production RBAC gaps have already been
found by hand this way -- kairon-ui's ClusterRole was missing get/list/watch
for six dashboard routes (fixed in 3a75458/4ba53f8), and kairon-controller's
ClusterRole is missing "delete" on machinesnapshots even though
reconcileMachineSnapshotSchedules' own keepLast pruning
(internal/controller/machinesnapshotschedule.go's pruneScheduledSnapshots)
calls Kube.DeleteMachineSnapshot every time a schedule has more than
keepLast ready snapshots (fixed alongside this script). Both gaps existed
because internal/kube's fake httptest.Server test doubles never enforce
RBAC, so `go test ./...` is silent about a real apiserver's 403 -- only
`helm template` plus a careful manual read of the ClusterRole ever caught
either one. This script automates that cross-check so a third one can't slip
in the same way.

How it works:
  1. Parses internal/kube/client.go itself to learn, for every exported
     *Client method, which Kubernetes (apiGroup, resource, verb) it needs --
     read directly from that method's own request path/verb, not guessed
     from its name, so this stays correct as methods are added or renamed.
  2. Renders charts/kairon/templates/all.yaml via `helm template` with every
     conditional RBAC-affecting flag turned on, so every ClusterRole/Role
     this chart can ever produce is present in one pass (mirrors this
     project's own documented gotcha: kairon-ui's whole RBAC block only
     renders with ui.enabled=true/ui.token=set, which is exactly how the
     first gap above went unnoticed).
  3. For each of kairon-controller/kairon-node/kairon-ui, statically greps
     that component's own source directories for which *Client methods it
     actually calls, and checks the rendered rules for its ServiceAccount's
     ClusterRole/Roles grant the (apiGroup, resource, verb) each call needs.

Known, deliberate scope limits (real limits, not hidden gaps):
  - Only cross-checks kairon-controller, kairon-node, and kairon-ui. Neither
    kairon-csi-controller nor kairon-csi-node calls internal/kube.Client at
    all (they only implement the CSI gRPC interface; their own RBAC backs
    the upstream CSI sidecar containers, not code in this repo), and
    kaironctl runs under the invoking operator's own kubeconfig/RBAC, not a
    ServiceAccount this chart grants -- there is nothing here to check for
    either.
  - Never checks the "watch" verb: nothing in this codebase actually issues
    a watch (every reconcile loop polls via List on a timer), so there is no
    call site to derive a "watch is needed" fact from. Every ClusterRole
    grants "watch" defensively; this script neither requires nor flags it.
  - Ignores `resourceNames` scoping -- a rule granting "get"/"patch" on
    "secrets" scoped to resourceNames: ["kairon-ui-users"] counts as full
    coverage for GetSecret/PatchSecretStringData, without checking the
    specific object name matches. In practice every such call site already
    targets exactly the one name the Role was scoped to.
  - Does not distinguish ClusterRole (cluster-wide) from a namespaced Role
    scope; both simply contribute (resource, verb) grants for their
    ServiceAccount. Good enough here since every namespaced Role in this
    chart binds to the same namespace the component itself runs in.
