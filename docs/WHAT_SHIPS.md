# What ships today

Full feature inventory formerly maintained in the root README. Guides linked below remain authoritative for how-to detail.

**Machine lifecycle & placement**
- **Machine CRD** — CPU, memory, image, network, power state, volumes, DRA device claims
- **`MachineSet`** — a Deployment/ReplicaSet-shaped fleet of identical Machines from one template, with `RollingUpdate`/`Recreate` rollout — [guide](guides/machine-sets.md)
- **`MachineInstanceType`** — a reusable named CPU/memory shape (`spec.instanceTypeName`), resolved into `spec.resources` once instead of inlining it every time — [guide](guides/machine-instance-types.md)
- **NUMA topology, CPU set, hugepages** (`spec.resources.numaNode`/`.cpuSet`/`.hugepages`, qemu-only) — direct passthroughs to FluxVM's own existing support, refused with a clear error on a non-qemu backend rather than silently ignored — [guide](guides/machine-cpu-numa.md)
- **Real CPU pinning** (`spec.resources.cpuPinning`, qemu-only) — exclusive host-core allocation, a real scheduler capacity model against operator-asserted `kairon.zyvor.dev/pinnable-cpus` node labels — atomically patched alongside node assignment, applied via the same cgroup `cpuset.cpus` write `spec.resources.limits` already uses — [guide](guides/machine-cpu-pinning.md)
- **Windows guests** — legacy-BIOS Windows Server/10 with a pre-built, virtio-driver + cloudbase-init image works today (`spec.cloudInit` unchanged); `spec.security.secureBoot`/`.tpm` (Windows 11) now pass through to FluxVM's own real OVMF Secure Boot (qemu-only) and emulated TPM 2.0 (qemu or cloud-hypervisor) — Kairon enforces the same backend restriction FluxVM's own scheduler does, refusing an unsupported combination with a clear error rather than relaying a bare FluxVM 400. A real Secure Boot chain still needs the FluxVM node itself configured with an OVMF vars template (an operator responsibility, not something Kairon manages) — [guide](guides/machine-windows-guests.md)
- **`MigrationPolicy`** — scopes migration bandwidth/concurrency to Machines matching a selector, independent of the global `migration.maxConcurrentPerNode`/`maxConcurrentCluster` caps — [guide](guides/migration-policies.md)
- **PVC-backed boot disk** — `spec.volumes[0]` resolves through a Bound `PersistentVolumeClaim` to a real host directory (`hostPath`/`local` `PersistentVolume`s directly, or a network-block volume via Kairon's own first-cut CSI driver) instead of a hand-placed image file — [guide](guides/machine-storage.md) · [CSI guide](guides/machine-storage-csi.md)
- **Third-party CSI client** (`node.thirdPartyCSIDrivers`, first cut) — `kairon-node` acts as its own generic CSI client against an operator-allowlisted third-party driver's socket (validated conceptually against Ceph-CSI/RBD), for `attachRequired: false`, no-secret drivers only — [guide](guides/machine-storage-thirdparty-csi.md)
- **Image import** (`spec.image.source`, opt-in via `node.imageCacheDir`) — `kairon-node` downloads a remote qcow2/raw image URL into its own digest-keyed cache instead of requiring a hand-placed file, shared across every Machine naming the same digest — [guide](guides/machine-image-import.md)
- **Image catalog** (`spec.image.catalogName`, admin-only for mutations, API-only) — reference a named, checksummed (optionally signed) FluxVM image-catalog alias instead of a raw path; node-scoped register/rename/clone/export/read-only API — [guide](guides/machine-image-catalog.md)
- **Egress check** (admin-only, API-only) — ask a node whether a sandbox's outbound request to a host would be allowed under its static egress allowlist, with any matched credential-vault secret reported only as a boolean — [guide](guides/machine-sandboxes.md#checking-egress-policy)
- **Warm pools** (admin-only, API-only) — create a FluxVM pool of pre-booted, `Paused` VMs for instant claiming instead of a cold create; node-scoped create/list/get/delete/claim API — [guide](guides/machine-sandboxes.md#warm-pools)
- **Runtime diagnostics** (freeze/thaw admin-only, rest any-operator, API-only) — a node's real FluxVM capability manifest, a Machine's cgroup-derived PSI pressure stats and effective host CPU set, and a kernel-level cgroup freeze/thaw distinct from `spec.powerState: Paused` — [guide](guides/machine-diagnostics.md)
- **Network observability** (any-operator, API-only) — a Machine's fully-resolved effective network policy, real drop-reason/flow/stats data straight from FluxVM's eBPF dataplane — the direct answer to "why is my `MachineNetworkPolicy` blocking traffic" — [guide](guides/network-policy.md) ("Troubleshooting" section)
- **Placement** — least-loaded scheduling across Ready, capable-labeled nodes, deterministic tie-break, required (hard) `spec.placement.affinity`/`antiAffinity`, weighted soft scoring (`preferredAffinity`/`preferredAntiAffinity`, `topologySpreadConstraints`), a best-effort DRA topology-awareness hint, and `topologySpreadConstraints.maxSkew` hard enforcement via `whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule` — [guide](guides/machine-placement.md)
- **Scheduling priority** (`spec.priority`, first cut) — when a reconcile tick can't fit every still-pending Machine (not enough eligible nodes, or a `MachineQuota` at its cap), higher-`priority` Machines are attempted first; purely an admission-order signal for that tick's pending Machines, never preemption of an already-scheduled one however low its own priority — `kaironctl create`/`create machineset --priority N`, `kaironctl edit machine NAME --priority N` — [guide](guides/machine-placement.md#scheduling-priority)
- **DRA → VFIO** — an allocated `ResourceClaim`'s PCI BDF against the node's `vfio_devices` administrator allowlist, fail-closed (an empty allowlist denies all passthrough); device-type-agnostic, so this also covers **SR-IOV NIC passthrough** once a VF is bound to `vfio-pci` on the host — the same mechanism GPU passthrough already uses, not a Multus integration (Machines have no Pod for Multus to attach to) — [guide](guides/machine-sriov.md)
- **CPU/memory hotplug** — grow a running Machine's `spec.resources` via FluxVM's real QMP `device_add`/`object-add`, no reboot — [guide](guides/machine-hotplug.md)
- **Pause and resume** (`spec.powerState: Paused`) — suspend a running Machine's guest CPUs via FluxVM's real QMP `stop`/`cont` (backend-agnostic), RAM and device state fully resident, Kairon's `virtctl pause`/`unpause` equivalent — `kaironctl pause`/`resume`, or the dashboard — [guide](guides/machine-pause-resume.md)
- **Halt** (`spec.powerState: Halted`) — power a Machine's VMM process off while FluxVM keeps its own VM record/disk intact, freeing node capacity like `Stopped` but resuming via FluxVM's own kept config instead of a full Kairon-side recreate — `kaironctl halt`, or the dashboard — [guide](guides/machine-halt.md)
- **Live host resource limits** (`spec.resources.limits`) — a real, kernel-enforced cgroup v2 cap (CPU quota %, memory ceiling, I/O weight, PID count) on a running Machine's own VMM process, freely raisable/lowerable at any time, backend-agnostic — [guide](guides/machine-resource-limits.md)
- **Live resource usage** (`status.resourceUsage`) — real, cgroup-derived CPU/memory/disk-I/O usage refreshed every reconcile tick, shown inline in the dashboard next to each Machine — [guide](guides/machine-resource-limits.md)
- **`kaironctl top machines`/`top nodes`** — a `kubectl top`-style live usage view over that same `status.resourceUsage` data, no new metrics pipeline: `top machines` prints each Machine's own CPU%/memory/disk-I/O, `top nodes` rolls those same per-Machine samples up by `spec.nodeName` (`model.AggregateUsageByNode`) into a per-host hotspot view `kaironctl get machines` alone can't answer without manually grouping rows. The same rollup backs the dashboard's **Nodes** page (`GET /api/v1/nodes/usage`) below — [guide](guides/machine-resource-limits.md)
- **Guest agent** (`spec.guestAgent`) — real `qemu-guest-agent`-reported `status.guestIP`, including for `user`/SLIRP networking, which has no DHCP lease to parse at all — [guide](guides/machine-guest-agent.md)
- **Guest exec** (`spec.guestAgent.enabled`, admin-only) — run a one-shot command inside the guest via `kairon-ui`'s dashboard, no SSH/console needed — real `qemu-guest-agent` guest-exec, synchronous, exit code + stdout/stderr — [guide](guides/machine-guest-exec.md)
- **Text console** (`spec.guestAgent.console`) — an interactive shell in-browser (xterm.js), Kairon's `virtctl console` equivalent, working on every backend — requires FluxVM's own proprietary `fluxvm-guest-agent` baked into the guest image — [guide](guides/machine-text-console.md)
- **Guest file access** (`spec.guestAgent.console`, admin-only) — read or write a file inside a `Running` guest at runtime, no SSH/shared volume needed — same `fluxvm-guest-agent` channel as the text console — [guide](guides/machine-guest-agent-files.md)
- **Backend-agnostic guest exec** (`spec.guestAgent.console`, admin-only, API-only) — run a command over FluxVM's own vsock agent instead of `qemu-guest-agent` — the only guest-exec path that works on Cloud Hypervisor/Firecracker/FluxVm-backend sandboxes, not just QEMU — [guide](guides/machine-guest-agent-files.md)
- **Sandboxes** (`spec.sandbox`, admin-only, API-only) — run a Machine on FluxVM's own lightweight, fast-boot in-tree hypervisor track for short-lived ephemeral workloads, optionally from a pre-built template; includes an HTTP proxy relay straight into the guest's own web server — [guide](guides/machine-sandboxes.md)
- **Machine logs** — `kubectl logs`/`-f` equivalent: the VM's real captured serial console output, with a live-tailing **Follow** toggle, same any-operator authorization as the VNC console — [guide](guides/machine-logs.md)
- **VM-state snapshot/restore** (admin-only, API-only) — a full hypervisor-level checkpoint of a running Machine's RAM/CPU/device state via FluxVM's real `savevm`/Cloud Hypervisor snapshot, restored back into the same Machine in place; distinct from `MachineSnapshot`'s disk-content-only CSI snapshot — [guide](guides/machine-vm-state-snapshot.md)

**Migration**
- **Cold migrate & evacuate** — stop → reassign → restart, restart-safe in the API
- **Secure live handshake** — TLS 1.3 mTLS `prepare → transfer → commit`, never a user-supplied `tcp:` URI
- **Split-brain guards** — rollback on transfer failure, `NeedsRecovery` on ambiguous commit, adopt-only cutover
- **A real migration adapter ships** — `cmd/kairon-migration-adapter-fluxvm` against real FluxVM endpoints, not just a test double
- **Node fencing is detection + operator-attested action, never a guess** — `kairon-controller` flags a Machine's node `NodeUnreachable` every reconcile tick but never reschedules it itself (that risks running the same VM twice if the node isn't actually dead); `kaironctl fence --reason ...` is the explicit, attested step that clears it for rescheduling — same shape as `NeedsRecovery`. Opt-in `node.livenessLease.enabled` gives fence a second, independent signal (a `coordination.k8s.io/v1` Lease kairon-node renews itself) to refuse fencing a node it still looks alive on, despite `NodeUnreachable=True`. Opt-in `kairon.zyvor.dev/storage-domain`/`network-domain` node labels also let migration preflight block a target when it's *confirmed* to not share storage/network with the source — [guide](guides/machine-fencing.md)

**Guarding the fleet**
- **`MachineDisruptionBudget`** — `kaironctl evacuate` throttles itself against `minAvailable`/`maxUnavailable` instead of taking a whole node's Machines at once; `kairon-controller` now reconciles real `status` every tick too (`kaironctl get budgets`/`kubectl get mdb`), purely observational. `kaironctl create budget NAME --selector k=v (--min-available X | --max-unavailable X)`/`edit budget NAME [--selector k=v] [--min-available X] [--max-unavailable X]` create and mutate one directly — no more dropping to `kubectl apply`/YAML just to stand one up — [guide](guides/machine-disruption-budgets.md)
- **Cordon-triggered automatic evacuation** (`controller.cordonEvacuation.enabled`, opt-in) — `kairon-controller` itself migrates every Machine off a Node the moment it's cordoned, budget-throttled exactly like `kaironctl evacuate`, mirroring KubeVirt's `LiveMigrateIfPossible` — [guide](guides/machine-disruption-budgets.md#automatic-cordon-triggered-evacuation)
- **`MachineQuota`** — a namespace-scoped `maxMachines`/`maxTotalCpu`/`maxTotalMemory` cap. `kaironctl create quota NAME [--max-machines N] [--max-total-cpu N] [--max-total-memory SIZE]`/`edit quota NAME [flags]` create and mutate one directly — [guide](guides/machine-quotas.md)
- **Admission webhook** (`webhook.enabled`, opt-in) — both of the above can now be enforced *at admission*, not just in the reconcile loop or `kaironctl`: a `Machine` create that would blow a quota, or a `MachineMigration` create that would violate a budget, gets rejected outright instead of just parked `Pending` or silently allowed. See [Guarding the fleet](guides/admission-webhook.md) below.
- **Network Fabric** — `spec.network`, `MachineNetworkPolicy`, `NetworkSecurityGroup`, Service Fabric VIP membership → FluxVM eBPF edge — [reference](network-fabric.md)

**Snapshots**
- **CSI VolumeSnapshot** — `MachineSnapshot` orchestrates a standard snapshot object; `MachineSnapshotRestore` restores one into a *new* `PersistentVolumeClaim` via the standard CSI `dataSource` flow (deliberately doesn't also create a Machine — see the guide for why) — [guide](guides/machine-snapshot-restore.md)
- **Guest quiesce for snapshots** (`spec.guestAgent.enabled`) — a real `guest-fsfreeze`/`-thaw` around `MachineSnapshot`'s VolumeSnapshot creation for an application-consistent snapshot, coordinated between `kairon-controller` and `kairon-node` since only the node has a network path to the Machine's FluxVM instance — [guide](guides/machine-snapshot-quiesce.md)
- **`MachineSnapshotSchedule`** (first cut) — periodically creates a `MachineSnapshot` for every Machine matching a label selector on a plain `spec.intervalSeconds`, Kairon's own backup-automation primitive — deliberately not real cron syntax. `spec.keepLast` optionally retains only the N most recent ready-to-use snapshots per Machine, pruning older ones the schedule itself created (never a manually-created one). `status.nextRunTime` projects when a schedule's next round is expected (`kaironctl get snapshotschedules`' NEXTRUN column, `kubectl get machinesnapshotschedules`' own NextRun printer column, and the dashboard's **Next run** column all show it) — a simple as-of-last-fire projection, not a live countdown; `kaironctl`/the dashboard both check the live `spec.suspend` flag before trusting it, so a schedule suspended after its last run never shows a stale already-passed timestamp. The dashboard's own **Snapshot schedules** page lists every schedule and can suspend/resume one with a click — the one write action exposed there so far; `spec.selector`/`.intervalSeconds`/`.keepLast` still need `kaironctl`/`kubectl` to edit. `kaironctl describe snapshotschedule NAME` previews exactly which Machines its selector currently matches and whether the next reconcile tick would actually fire a new round of snapshots for them, evaluated with the same `Spec.Due` check the controller itself uses — a real "what would this do right now" question worth answering before loosening/tightening a selector or interval, without waiting for the next tick to find out. `spec.startingDeadlineSeconds` (opt-in, unset by default) is Kairon's analog of Kubernetes `CronJob`'s field of the same name: a run discovered more than that many seconds late — e.g. after `kairon-controller` was down, or this CRD's status was reset by a reinstall — is skipped rather than fired as a stale catch-up, though the schedule's own clock still advances so it doesn't re-detect the same missed window forever; `status.lastRunError` records the skip, surfaced the same way any other run error already is (`kaironctl get`/`describe`, the dashboard's **Last error** column). `kaironctl trigger snapshotschedule NAME` requests an immediate, out-of-band run — "back up these Machines right now" without waiting for `intervalSeconds` to elapse, or temporarily touching `suspend`/`intervalSeconds` to force one — implemented as a durable request annotation (`kairon.zyvor.dev/trigger-now`) the controller notices and acts on its very next reconcile tick, bypassing both `spec.suspend` and `spec.startingDeadlineSeconds` (a paused schedule can still be asked for one snapshot without permanently unpausing it, and "right now" is never "too late"); `status.lastHandledTriggerTime` records which request was already handled so the same one is never re-fired — [guide](guides/machine-snapshot-schedules.md)

**Operate it**
- **`kaironctl`** — create, start/stop, migrate, evacuate, snapshot, recover
- **`kairon-ui`** — an optional web dashboard, real per-operator login with in-place password change/reset (not "regenerate a hash and redeploy"), optional OIDC/SSO, a `NeedsRecovery` recovery workflow, an optional VNC console, and more than one replica once you need it — see [The dashboard](getting-started.md#deploy-the-web-dashboard)
- **`kairon-controller` HA** — `controller.replicaCount` can go above 1: a `coordination.k8s.io/v1` Lease (`internal/leaderelection`, on by default) coordinates replicas so only the elected leader reconciles, while the admission webhook and health/metrics endpoints keep serving from every replica regardless — see [guide](guides/kairon-controller-ha.md)
- **Prometheus metrics + alert rules**, a per-node/cluster migration concurrency quota, `status.dataPlaneEncrypted` visibility into whether a live transfer is actually encrypted
- **`PodDisruptionBudget`** on by default, opt-in `NetworkPolicy`, digest-pinned + Trivy-scanned + cosign-signed + SBOM'd container images, Helm + raw manifests + CI

Live *memory* transfer needs a node-local [migration adapter](migration-adapter.md) deployed and configured on each node — without one, a live request blocks before the source is touched. Cold migration needs nothing extra and works today.
