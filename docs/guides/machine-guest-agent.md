# User guide: guest agent (real guest IP reporting)

How to opt a Machine into FluxVM's real `qemu-guest-agent` channel, and why
you'd want to.

## The problem this solves

`status.guestIP` normally comes from parsing a dnsmasq DHCP lease file --
but that only exists for `spec.network.mode: tap` with `netns: true`. Every
other network mode (in particular `user`, SLIRP -- Kairon's default) has no
lease file at all, so `status.guestIP` just stays empty forever, even
though the guest genuinely has a real, working IP address.

## How to enable it

```yaml
apiVersion: kairon.zyvor.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Machine
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  guestAgent:
    enabled: true
  cloudInit:
    packages: ["qemu-guest-agent"]   # the guest has to actually run it
  # ... unchanged otherwise
```

Two things have to both be true: `spec.guestAgent.enabled: true` (tells
FluxVM to add the virtio-serial channel to the VM) and the guest actually
running `qemu-guest-agent` (most cloud images don't ship it by default --
`spec.cloudInit.packages` is the easiest way to get it installed and
started at first boot).

Once both are true, `kairon-node` asks the real guest agent for its network
interfaces (`guest-network-get-interfaces`) whenever it doesn't already have
a `status.guestIP` from a DHCP lease -- the guest's own kernel-reported
address, not a host-side guess.

## How Kairon picks an address

`status.guestIP` stays a single string for backward compatibility (it's
what `kubectl get machine`'s IP column and every existing consumer already
expect), but `status.guestIPs` (and `status.network.guestIPs`) now report
every address the guest agent sees, across every non-loopback interface --
IPv4 addresses first, then IPv6, in interface order. `status.guestIP` is
always `status.guestIPs[0]`: the first IPv4 address found anywhere, falling
back to the first IPv6 address only if the guest has no IPv4 address at
all. If your guest has more than one NIC, `status.guestIP` alone still
can't tell you which one it picked -- read `status.guestIPs` (or
`status.network.guestIPs`) for the full picture.

## Real limits today (v1 of this feature)

- Re-resolved periodically, not forever-sticky: once an address is first
  resolved, Kairon re-verifies with the guest agent every 5 minutes (not
  every reconcile tick) and updates `status.guestIP`/`status.guestIPs` if
  it changed. Before the first successful resolution, it's retried every
  reconcile tick instead (the guest agent may simply not have booted yet).
  A `kairon-node` restart resets the 5-minute clock and triggers one
  immediate re-check, which is expected, not a bug.
- A guest agent that isn't installed or hasn't started yet just means
  `status.guestIP`/`status.guestIPs` stay empty and resolution is retried
  on the next reconcile tick -- not a hard error.
- This is unrelated to FluxVM's own bespoke `spec.agent` (a different,
  vsock-based protocol requiring its own FluxVM-specific guest binary,
  `fluxvm-guest-agent`) -- exposed as the separate, independent
  `spec.guestAgent.console` flag, powering an interactive text console
  ([guide](machine-text-console.md)). `spec.guestAgent.enabled` here is
  specifically the real, upstream `qemu-guest-agent` over virtio-serial.
  This same `enabled` flag also gates two other, separately
  documented capabilities built on that same channel: application-
  consistent `MachineSnapshot` quiesce
  ([guide](machine-snapshot-quiesce.md)) and running a one-shot command
  inside the guest ([guide](machine-guest-exec.md)).
