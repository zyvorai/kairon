# User guide: installing from an ISO (`spec.cdroms`, `spec.image.blank`)

Boot a Machine from installer media onto an empty disk: Windows Setup, a
Linux installer, or any appliance ISO. No KubeVirt, no CDI, no PVC upload.

```yaml
apiVersion: kairon.zyvor.dev/v1beta1
kind: Machine
metadata: {name: win-builder, namespace: images}
spec:
  image: {blank: true, diskSize: 80Gi}
  cdroms:
  - {name: install, imageRef: windows-server-2022-iso}
  - {name: virtio, imageRef: virtio-win}
  resources: {cpu: "4", memory: 8Gi}
  security: {secureBoot: true, tpm: true}
  runtime: {backend: qemu}
```

## What happens

- `spec.image.blank` boots an empty root disk of `spec.image.diskSize`.
  kairon-node overlays a shared 1 MiB empty base in its image cache and
  FluxVM grows the overlay, so the disk costs nothing until the guest
  writes to it.
- Each `spec.cdroms` entry is an ISO attached **read-only** as a SATA CD-ROM
  on the q35 machine's built-in AHCI controller. Windows Setup sees it with
  no extra drivers. At most 4.
- No boot order is forced. Firmware skips the blank disk and boots the first
  CD-ROM. After installation the OS writes its own boot entry, so reboots
  come up from the disk.
- ISOs come from a `MachineImage` of `kind: iso` (`imageRef`) or directly
  from `source.httpURL` + `digest`. They land in the same digest-keyed node
  cache as boot images, so 50 installs from one ISO download it once.

## Windows

Windows Setup can't see a virtio disk until it loads the driver. Attach the
VirtIO driver ISO as a second CD-ROM (`virtio` above) and choose **Load
driver → `viostor\2k22\amd64`** when Setup shows no disk. Install the
VirtIO drivers and the QEMU guest agent from the same CD before you seal
the image.

UEFI ISOs show "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD" for a few seconds.
Open the console (VNC) right after creating the Machine to catch it.

## Turning an install into a golden image

1. Install, update, then `Sysprep.exe /generalize /shutdown /oobe /mode:vm`.
2. Copy the root disk off the node (a [`MachineBackup`](machine-backup.md),
   or the FluxVM overlay flattened with `qemu-img convert`), serve it over
   HTTP(S) and publish it as a `MachineImage` of `kind: disk`
   ([`machine-images.md`](machine-images.md)).
3. Create Machines with `spec.image.imageRef`.

## Persistent installs on a volume

With `spec.volumes[0]` set, `blank: true` creates the empty disk **inside
the volume** (`disk.img`, sparse, `diskSize` bytes) instead of in the node
cache. See [`machine-storage.md`](machine-storage.md#seeding-a-boot-volume).

## Limits

- QEMU backend only.
- Requires a FluxVM with `CreateVmRequest.cdroms` (fluxvm PR #142 or later).
  An older FluxVM ignores the field and boots the blank disk with no media.
- `spec.cdroms` is creation-time-only, like the rest of `spec.image`.
- FluxVM refuses to live-migrate a VM that has media attached. Rebuild the
  Machine from the sealed image to get a migratable VM.
