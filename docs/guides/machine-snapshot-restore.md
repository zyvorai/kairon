# User guide: restoring a MachineSnapshot

How to get a usable disk back out of a `MachineSnapshot`, and why this is a
two-step flow rather than one "restore my VM" button.

## Why there's no in-place restore

A Kubernetes `PersistentVolumeClaim`'s `spec.dataSource` can't be changed
after the PVC is bound -- there is no such thing as "restore this existing
PVC back to an earlier snapshot" in the Kubernetes/CSI storage model.
Restoring **always** means creating a **new** PVC whose `dataSource` points
at the snapshot. That also means "restore" and "clone-from-snapshot" are
the same operation here -- there's no meaningful difference to model
separately.

`Machine.spec.volumes` is creation-time-only (same as `spec.image`/
`spec.resources`) -- editing it on an already-realized Machine has no
effect. So restoring into an existing running Machine isn't possible either;
what you actually get is a fresh PVC you point a **new** `Machine` at.

## The two steps

**1. Restore the snapshot into a new PVC:**

```bash
kaironctl restore my-snapshot --target-claim db-restored-pvc
```

or as a CRD:

```yaml
apiVersion: kairon.zyvor.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MachineSnapshotRestore
metadata:
  name: db-restore-1
spec:
  snapshotName: my-snapshot
  targetClaimName: db-restored-pvc
  # volumeName: root       # required only if the snapshot covers more than one volume
  # storageClassName: ""   # empty uses the cluster default
  # storageSize: ""        # empty defaults to the VolumeSnapshot's own reported restoreSize
```

`kairon-controller` creates a real `PersistentVolumeClaim` named
`db-restored-pvc` with `spec.dataSource` pointing at the snapshot's
underlying `VolumeSnapshot`. Watch it with `kaironctl get restores` --
`status.phase` goes `Pending` → `Succeeded` once the PVC is `Bound`.
Under a `WaitForFirstConsumer` `StorageClass` (the common case, e.g.
Rancher's `local-path-provisioner`), the PVC stays `Pending` until step 2
gives it a consumer -- that's normal, not a failure.

Or from the dashboard: the **Restores** page lists every
`MachineSnapshotRestore` in the `default` namespace with its snapshot,
target claim, phase, and (once `Succeeded`) the restored claim name, and a
form creates a new one without needing `kaironctl`/`kubectl` for that one
action. The **Snapshots** page's own table grows a **Restore** button on
each row once that snapshot is `readyToUse` -- it jumps to the Restores
page with `spec.snapshotName` pre-filled, the same "prefill and switch
page" pattern the **Snapshot** button on the Machines page already uses
for creating a `MachineSnapshot`. A **Delete** button is also available on
each restore row -- deleting a `MachineSnapshotRestore` only ever removes
that bookkeeping object; the `PersistentVolumeClaim` it already created is
a normal, independent object once `status.phase` reaches `Succeeded` and
is never cascade-deleted with it (same posture `kubectl delete` on a
completed `Job` takes toward what the `Job` produced).

**2. Point a new Machine at it** (this is just the existing PVC-backed boot
disk feature -- see [docs/guides/machine-storage.md](machine-storage.md)):

```yaml
apiVersion: kairon.zyvor.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Machine
metadata:
  name: db-restored
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: root
      claimName: db-restored-pvc
  resources: {cpu: "2", memory: "4Gi"}
  runtime: {backend: qemu}
  powerState: Running
```

## Why this doesn't also create the Machine for you

The alternative -- `MachineSnapshotRestore` also constructing and creating a
full `Machine` object -- would mean either requiring the original Machine to
still exist (so its spec can be copied), which defeats the main real-world
use case (the original Machine is gone, that's *why* you're restoring), or
duplicating a whole Machine-spec templating scheme inside this CRD. Keeping
storage restoration and VM creation as two separate, already-solved steps
is simpler and works in the disaster-recovery case that actually matters.

## Real limits today (v1 of this feature)

- One volume restored per `MachineSnapshotRestore` -- for a Machine with
  multiple snapshotted volumes, create one restore object per volume you
  need back.
- No admission-time validation beyond what the CRD schema enforces -- there's
  no earlier warning at `kubectl apply` time if `spec.snapshotName` points at
  a `MachineSnapshot` that isn't `Succeeded`/ready yet, or doesn't exist at
  all yet. Neither is treated as an immediate failure: `status.phase` parks
  at `Pending` (message names exactly what it's waiting on) and retries
  automatically every reconcile tick, the same "waiting on an external
  condition" posture step 1's own PVC-`Pending` case above already has --
  so creating the restore slightly before its snapshot finishes, or even
  slightly before the snapshot object itself exists (both Machines and
  MachineSnapshots created together in one GitOps apply, ordering not
  guaranteed), just works once the snapshot catches up, no need to delete
  and recreate it. The "doesn't exist at all yet" case is bounded to a
  30-second grace period (from the restore's own `creationTimestamp`) --
  long enough to absorb an ordinary apply-ordering race, short enough that
  a genuinely missing/misspelled `spec.snapshotName` still surfaces as
  `Failed` within a bounded, human-noticeable time rather than sitting
  `Pending` forever. `status.phase: Failed` is reserved for what actually
  can't resolve itself: `spec.snapshotName` still unresolved past that
  grace period, a missing/misspelled `spec.targetClaimName`, an
  ambiguous/unknown `spec.volumeName`, or a real PVC-creation error.
