# User guide: Machine placement

How `spec.placement` steers which node a Machine lands on, and what today's
real limits are.

## Fields

| Field | What it does | Hard or soft |
|---|---|---|
| `architecture` | Only consider nodes whose `kubernetes.io/arch` label matches | Hard |
| `nodeSelector` | Only consider nodes matching every given label | Hard |
| `affinity` | Require co-location with at least one other Machine matching a selector | Hard |
| `antiAffinity` | Require separation from every other Machine matching a selector | Hard |
| `preferredAffinity` | Weighted preference to co-locate with a matching Machine | Soft |
| `preferredAntiAffinity` | Weighted preference to separate from a matching Machine | Soft |
| `topologySpreadConstraints` | Weighted preference to spread matching Machines evenly across a topology label's domains; hard-caps skew too if `whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule` | Soft, or hard per-constraint |
| `tolerations` | Lets this Machine schedule onto a node carrying a matching `Taint` it would otherwise be excluded from (`NoSchedule`/`NoExecute`), or avoid the score penalty for one it would otherwise (`PreferNoSchedule`) | Hard for `NoSchedule`/`NoExecute`, soft for `PreferNoSchedule` |

The first four fields are always-hard filters evaluated at scheduling time
by `internal/scheduler`'s `eligible` check: a node failing one is never a
candidate at all. `preferredAffinity`/`preferredAntiAffinity` never reject
a node -- they only influence which *eligible* node wins, via a real
weighted scoring pass (`internal/scheduler.score`).
`topologySpreadConstraints` is scored the same way regardless, but each
constraint can *also* hard-filter (see below) if you ask it to.
`tolerations` doesn't filter or score anything by itself -- it only ever
cancels out a *node's own* taint (see below), the opposite direction from
every other field in this table, which all filter/score based on the
Machine's own placement preferences. None of these fields influence an
already-scheduled Machine (`spec.nodeName` is set once, at scheduling
time, same as `spec.image`/`spec.resources`).

When every node is filtered out, the resulting error names which
constraint(s) actually did it -- aggregated per distinct reason across
every excluded node (e.g. `2 node(s): nodeSelector zone=us-east not
satisfied; 1 node(s): cpuPinning requests 8 vCPU(s), only 4 free`) --
rather than one undifferentiated "no nodes match" message, so debugging a
stuck `Machine` doesn't require guessing which of `architecture`/
`nodeSelector`/affinity/anti-affinity/`cpuPinning` capacity is the actual
blocker.

## Affinity and anti-affinity

```yaml
apiVersion: kairon.zyvor.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Machine
metadata:
  name: cache
spec:
  placement:
    affinity:
      - labelSelector: {tier: web}
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    antiAffinity:
      - labelSelector: {role: db-primary}
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

Each term is `{labelSelector, topologyKey}` — deliberately shaped like
Kubernetes Pod affinity terms, so it's immediately familiar:

- **`affinity`**: the candidate node is eligible only if at least one other
  Machine matching `labelSelector` is currently scheduled to a node sharing
  the candidate's value for the `topologyKey` label.
- **`antiAffinity`**: the candidate node is eligible only if **no** other
  Machine matching `labelSelector` shares the candidate's `topologyKey`
  value.
- `topologyKey` names any node label -- `kubernetes.io/hostname` for
  same/different-node, or a rack/zone/region label your nodes carry, for
  broader placement domains.
- A Machine never matches its own affinity/anti-affinity terms against
  itself (relevant when re-evaluating an already-scheduled Machine, e.g. as
  a live-migration target search).

## Preferred (soft) affinity and topology spread

```yaml
apiVersion: kairon.zyvor.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Machine
metadata:
  name: cache
spec:
  placement:
    preferredAffinity:
      - weight: 20
        labelSelector: {tier: web}
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    preferredAntiAffinity:
      - weight: 10
        labelSelector: {role: db-primary}
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    topologySpreadConstraints:
      - topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
        labelSelector: {tier: web}
```

Each eligible node's score starts at `-(Machines already assigned to it)`
(the whole of the old load-balancing behavior) and then:

- `preferredAffinity`/`preferredAntiAffinity` add/subtract that term's
  `weight` when satisfied (same `{labelSelector, topologyKey}` semantics
  as the hard fields above, just non-rejecting).
- `topologySpreadConstraints` subtracts however many other Machines
  matching `labelSelector` are already in that node's `topologyKey`
  domain -- more existing matches there, lower score, favoring the
  emptier domain.
- The highest-scoring eligible node wins; a Machine with none of these
  three fields set schedules identically to before this scoring pass
  existed (least-loaded, deterministic hash tie-break on exact ties).

There's no fixed range for `weight` -- it's compared directly against the
1-point-per-Machine load penalty, so pick it relative to how much load
imbalance you want the preference to be able to outweigh (weight 20
comfortably beats several Machines' worth of imbalance; weight 1 only
matters when load is already tied).

## Hard-enforcing `topologySpreadConstraints.maxSkew`

```yaml
    topologySpreadConstraints:
      - topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
        labelSelector: {tier: web}
        maxSkew: 1
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
```

`whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule` (mirroring the Kubernetes field exactly)
turns this one constraint into a real filter, on top of the scoring it
already gets: a candidate node is dropped outright if placing this
Machine there would push that domain's skew (the matching-Machine count in
that domain versus the least-populated domain among candidates) over
`maxSkew`. Every domain still eligible after *all* `DoNotSchedule`
constraints are applied moves on to the same weighted scoring as before;
`Choose` returns an error if none are left. Omitting `whenUnsatisfiable`,
or setting it to `ScheduleAnyway` (the default, and every
`topologySpreadConstraints` entry before this field existed), never
rejects a node over skew -- `maxSkew` stays purely informational for
scoring, exactly as before.

`maxSkew`'s zero value (unset, same as writing `0` explicitly -- there's
no way to tell those apart through this field alone) is treated as a real
"domains must stay perfectly balanced," not as disabling enforcement --
the stricter of the two readings, deliberately, matching this project's
general fail-closed posture elsewhere. A real Kubernetes cluster's API
server would reject `maxSkew: 0` outright as invalid; Kairon has no
equivalent admission-time field validation to hook a rejection into, so
if you meant to write a positive number, write one.

## Taints and tolerations

```yaml
apiVersion: kairon.zyvor.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Machine
metadata:
  name: gpu-job
spec:
  placement:
    tolerations:
      - key: dedicated
        operator: Equal
        value: gpu
        effect: NoSchedule
```

A `Node` here is the real Kubernetes `Node` object `kairon-controller`
already lists every reconcile tick -- `internal/scheduler` now also reads
its `spec.taints` (previously decoded by nothing in this project at all)
the same way a real `kube-scheduler` does. Kairon itself never sets a
taint; this is entirely about respecting whatever's already on the node --
a manual `kubectl taint`, a cloud provider's spot-instance taint, a
`node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` taint from a lost kubelet, or anything
else already there before Kairon looked.

- **`NoSchedule`/`NoExecute`** taints are a hard filter, same enforcement
  point as `architecture`/`nodeSelector`/`affinity`: a node carrying one
  is never a candidate for a Machine that doesn't tolerate it. When every
  node is filtered out, the aggregated error names it exactly like any
  other blocking reason, e.g. `1 node(s): untolerated NoSchedule taint
  dedicated=gpu`.
- **`PreferNoSchedule`** taints are soft, same enforcement point as
  `preferredAffinity`: an untolerated one only subtracts a fixed penalty
  from the node's score (`internal/scheduler`'s
  `preferNoScheduleTaintPenalty`, comparable in size to the DRA-preference
  bonus) -- it never removes the node from candidacy.
- A `Toleration` matches a `Taint` the same way Kubernetes' own
  `Toleration.ToleratesTaint` does: `key` must match (or be empty, which
  matches any key), `effect` must match if set (empty tolerates every
  effect for that key), and `operator: Equal` (the default when omitted)
  additionally requires `value` to match while `operator: Exists` ignores
  `value` entirely. An empty `key` with `operator: Exists` is Kubernetes'
  own "tolerate everything" wildcard toleration -- schedules onto any
  node regardless of what's tainted there.
- A Machine with no `tolerations` set schedules identically to before this
  field existed on an untainted fleet: nothing here changes what happens
  when `spec.taints` is empty on every node.

Before writing a `tolerations` entry you first need to know what's actually
tainted -- `kaironctl get nodes` lists every real Kubernetes `Node`
alongside its `Ready` condition, `spec.unschedulable`, and a `key[=value]:
Effect` summary of `spec.taints` (`-` when a node carries none), and
`kaironctl describe node NAME` dumps one node's full object, taints
included, the same raw-JSON way `describe` already works for every other
kind. Neither existed at all before this change -- an operator debugging
"why won't my Machine schedule onto NODE" once this section's own filtering
kicked in had no way to see a node's taints short of `kubectl get node
NODE -o yaml`, even though `kaironctl` already had full `get`/`describe`
for every kairon.zyvor.dev kind. `Node` is cluster-scoped, unlike
everything else `kaironctl get`/`describe` supports, so `-n`/`--namespace`
is silently ignored for it; there's no `kaironctl delete node`, since
deleting a cluster Node is squarely `kubectl`'s job, not Kairon's.

The dashboard now shows the same information: `kairon-ui`'s **Nodes** page
lists every node's `Ready` condition, `Unschedulable`, taints, and
addresses, refreshed every 5s like every other list page. `GET
/api/v1/nodes` already existed (it backed the Overview tile's node count),
but nothing in the dashboard rendered the list itself until this page --
an operator working only from the browser, not `kaironctl`/`kubectl`, had
no way to see a node's taints at all. Read-only, matching `kaironctl get
nodes`' own scope exactly: no create/edit/delete button, since Node's
lifecycle stays kubectl's job here too.

**Real limits today**: an untolerated `NoExecute` taint only ever blocks
*new* scheduling -- unlike real Kubernetes, Kairon has no eviction pass
that migrates or deletes an *already-running* Machine off a node that
becomes `NoExecute`-tainted after that Machine landed there (no
`tolerationSeconds` countdown either, since there's nothing to time out).
If you need a currently-running Machine off a freshly-tainted node,
`kaironctl evacuate NODE` (or cordoning the node, if `CordonEvacuation` is
enabled -- see `docs/guides/machine-disruption-budgets.md`) still works;
a taint alone doesn't trigger it automatically the way a cordon can.
Kairon also has no admission-time validation of `operator`/`effect`
values (same real limit `maxSkew`'s own section above already documents
for this project's placement fields generally) -- an unrecognized
`operator` fails closed, matching nothing, rather than being silently
treated as `Equal` or `Exists`.

## Scheduling priority

```yaml
apiVersion: kairon.zyvor.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Machine
metadata:
  name: urgent-vm
spec:
  priority: 10
```

Every field above steers *which node* a Machine lands on. `spec.priority`
answers a different question: *when several Machines are all still
unscheduled at once and can't all fit, which gets tried first?*

Every reconcile tick, `kairon-controller` collects every Machine that isn't
scheduled yet (no `spec.nodeName`), sorts that list by `spec.priority`
descending, then runs each one through placement (this page's own
eligibility/scoring pass) and, if a node is found, `MachineQuota` admission
-- in that order. A higher-`priority` Machine is attempted, and can claim
scarce node capacity or the last unit of `MachineQuota` headroom, before a
lower-priority one — even one that was created earlier, or that the API
happened to list first.

There's no fixed range for `priority`, same as `preferredAffinity`'s own
`weight` — pick any integer, positive or negative; the default is `0`. Ties
(the overwhelming common case: every Machine that doesn't set this field)
keep whatever order they'd have had anyway — the sort used is stable, so a
fleet that never sets `priority` schedules in exactly the order it always
did.

```
kaironctl create urgent-vm --image /base.qcow2 --priority 10
kaironctl create machineset web --image /base.qcow2 --replicas 5 --priority 5
kaironctl edit machine urgent-vm --priority 20
```

`kaironctl create`/`create machineset` both take `--priority N` (a
MachineSet's replicas all inherit its template's priority); `kaironctl edit
machine NAME --priority N` changes it on an existing Machine without a
delete/recreate — the one Machine-spec field this project's `edit` verb
supports patching after creation, since it only ever affects a *future*
tick's admission order.

The dashboard (kairon-ui) has the same capability: each row on the
Machines page carries a Priority field with a "Set" button that appears
once you change it, which `POST`s to
`/api/v1/machines/{namespace}/{name}/priority`
(`internal/uiapi/machines.go`'s `handleSetMachinePriority`) — the same
narrow, single-field `spec.priority` merge-patch `kaironctl edit machine`
issues, reusing the `patch` verb the ClusterRole already grants kairon-ui
on `machines` for power actions (no new RBAC). Any whole number is
accepted, including negative, same as the CLI.

**This is not preemption.** A high-`priority` Machine created after a
lower-`priority` one is already running never evicts, migrates, or
otherwise disturbs it — `priority` only ever orders Machines that are
*already* competing to be scheduled in the same tick, not Machines that
already won a previous tick. It also never changes *which* eligible node a
Machine lands on — that's still this page's own load/affinity/topology-spread
scoring, untouched. If you need a busy fleet to actively make room for a
new high-priority Machine by evicting a running lower-priority one, that's
real preemption — a materially riskier mechanism (choosing what to kill,
draining it cleanly, handling the case where nothing suitable exists to
evict) this project doesn't implement yet; this is a smaller, safer first
cut that solves the much more common "a burst of new Machines exceeds
capacity, who goes first" problem without it.

## Real limits today

- **DRA topology-awareness is a best-effort hint, not an allocation
  decision.** `kairon-controller` has no role in DRA device allocation
  itself -- for a Machine with `spec.deviceClaims`, it only reads back an
  already-allocated `ResourceClaim`'s device pool and, if that pool maps to
  a specific node via a `ResourceSlice`, adds a small fixed score bonus
  toward that node. An unallocated claim, or a pool with no single owning
  node (a network-attached device pool), contributes no hint at all --
  scheduling falls back to the other signals.
- **Evaluated against the reconcile-time Machine list, not a live watch.**
  A `Machine` scheduled in the same reconcile tick as the one it's meant to
  be co-located/separated from may not see that Machine's `spec.nodeName`
  yet (only set once its own scheduling completes) and fail with the same
  "no eligible nodes" message -- resolved automatically on the next
  reconcile tick (every `controller.interval`, 5s by default) once the
  other Machine has a node. This is a real, observed timing window, not a
  hypothetical -- it applies to `DoNotSchedule` topology-spread domain
  counts too, not just affinity/anti-affinity.
- **`DoNotSchedule` domains are only counted among candidate nodes, not
  every node in the cluster** -- a domain with matching Machines but no
  currently-eligible node in it (filtered out by `architecture`/
  `nodeSelector`/affinity/anti-affinity first) isn't part of the skew
  calculation at all, the same "candidate nodes matching the pod's own
  node affinity" scope real Kubernetes topology spread uses.
