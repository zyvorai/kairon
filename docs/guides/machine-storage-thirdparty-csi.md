# User guide: third-party CSI Machine storage (first cut)

**Scope, stated plainly up front:** this is a first cut, not a blanket
"works with any CSI driver" claim. It only works with drivers that (1) set
`attachRequired: false` on their `CSIDriver` object (no controller-side
`ControllerPublishVolume`/attach step -- Kairon runs no sidecar for that)
and (2) don't require a secret to be resolved for `NodeStageVolume`/
`NodePublishVolume` (Kairon never sends one -- see "Why no secrets" below).
The only driver this has been validated against conceptually (its request
shapes, not a live cluster) is Ceph-CSI/RBD, which is commonly deployed
exactly this way. Cloud block-storage drivers (EBS-CSI, PD-CSI, Azure Disk
CSI, etc.) require a controller-side attach step and **will not work**
here -- see "Real limits" below.

This is a separate mechanism from
[Kairon's own iSCSI CSI driver](machine-storage-csi.md)
(`internal/csinode`, deployed via `csiNode.enabled`): that guide covers
*driving* a CSI plugin Kairon itself ships. This guide covers
`kairon-node` acting as a generic CSI **client** against a third-party
driver's socket -- a different, larger piece of surface with its own real
limits.

## Why this exists

KubeVirt-class platforms can attach any CSI-backed `PersistentVolume` to a
VM because kubelet already acts as the CSI client for every Pod. A
`Machine` has no Pod, so nothing calls `NodeStageVolume`/
`NodePublishVolume` on its behalf. `kairon-node` already does this for its
own driver (`internal/agent/csi.go`); this feature lets it do the same
against an **operator-configured allowlist** of other drivers' sockets,
instead of only its own.

## Why no automatic driver discovery

A real CSI driver normally registers itself with kubelet via the
upstream `node-driver-registrar` sidecar, which populates
`/var/lib/kubelet/plugins_registry/` specifically expecting *kubelet* to
be the one dialing it (kubelet's own `pluginregistration.v1` service).
Reusing that discovery path would mean `kairon-node` re-implementing
kubelet's own plugin-registration listener. This first cut skips that
entirely: you name each driver and its socket path explicitly in
`node.thirdPartyCSIDrivers`, the same fail-closed-allowlist shape
`KAIRON_VFIO_ALLOWLIST` already has for VFIO passthrough. A driver not in
the list is refused outright -- `kairon-node` never dials an
unauthorized socket.

## Why no secrets

Kairon's own iSCSI driver already made this tradeoff
([documented here](machine-storage-csi.md#real-limits-today-first-cut)):
resolving a `nodeStageSecretRef`/`nodePublishSecretRef` would require
granting `kairon-node` `get` RBAC on Secrets named by whatever a Machine's
`PersistentVolume` happens to reference -- a real privilege-escalation
risk, since any Machine author could point a PV's secret ref at an
unrelated, sensitive Secret. This feature makes the identical choice for
third-party drivers: `Secrets` is always sent empty. This is the single
biggest compatibility limit -- Ceph-CSI/RBD supports secret-less
`userID`/keyring-in-`volumeAttributes` configurations for exactly this
kind of use case, which is why it's the validated reference driver; most
cloud drivers require a secret and won't work here regardless of the
attach-step limit below.

## Setup

1. Deploy the third-party driver's own DaemonSet as you normally would
   (outside Kairon entirely -- e.g. Ceph-CSI's own Helm chart), so its node
   plugin socket exists on each Kairon node, typically under
   `/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/<driver-name>/csi.sock`.

2. Allowlist it for `kairon-node`:

```yaml
# values.yaml
node:
  thirdPartyCSIDrivers:
    rbd.csi.ceph.com: /var/lib/kubelet/plugins/rbd.csi.ceph.com/csi.sock
```

This does two things: passes `--third-party-csi-drivers=rbd.csi.ceph.com=/var/...`
to `kairon-node`, and mounts the host's entire `/var/lib/kubelet/plugins`
directory read-only into the `kairon-node` container at the identical
path -- so whatever socket path you configure here is reachable
unmodified inside the container, with no per-driver volume/mount
templating needed. `kairon-node` only ever dials the one socket path
configured for a given driver name; it never lists or touches anything
else under that mount.

3. Create a `PersistentVolume` naming the third-party driver directly, the
   same shape it would take for a real Kubernetes Pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: db-root-rbd
spec:
  capacity: {storage: 20Gi}
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes: [ReadWriteOnce]
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  csi:
    driver: rbd.csi.ceph.com
    volumeHandle: "0001-0024-...-rbd-image-1"
    fsType: ext4
    volumeAttributes:
      clusterID: "my-ceph-cluster"
      pool: "kubevirt-pool"
      imageFeatures: "layering"
      # Any secret-requiring volumeAttributes (staticVolume with a
      # userID/userKey pair embedded directly, rather than a secretRef)
      # are the only way this reaches Ceph-CSI without RBAC escalation --
      # see "Why no secrets" above.
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: db-root-pvc
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes: [ReadWriteOnce]
  resources: {requests: {storage: 20Gi}}
  volumeName: db-root-rbd
  storageClassName: ""
```

Then reference it from a Machine exactly as any other PVC-backed boot
disk:

```yaml
apiVersion: kairon.zyvor.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Machine
metadata: {name: db}
spec:
  volumes: [{name: root, claimName: db-root-pvc}]
  resources: {cpu: "2", memory: "4Gi"}
  runtime: {backend: qemu}
  powerState: Running
```

On first reconcile, `kairon-node` dials `rbd.csi.ceph.com`'s socket
directly and calls `NodeStageVolume`/`NodePublishVolume`, then boots from
`<published path>/disk.img` -- the same `disk.img` convention every other
boot-disk source uses.
`status.volumeStagingPath`/`status.volumePublishPath`/`status.volumeHandle`/
`status.volumeDriver` record the result so this only happens once, not
every reconcile tick, and so teardown routes back to the correct driver
later even after the PV/PVC is already gone. `status.volumeDriver` stays
empty for a Machine using Kairon's own driver (or no CSI volume at all) --
existing Machines created before this field existed keep working
unchanged.

Editing `spec.volumes[0].claimName` away from a third-party-backed PVC (to
a different one, or removing `spec.volumes` entirely) tears down the old
volume via *its* driver's socket (`status.volumeDriver`, read before it's
overwritten) before the new one is ever recorded in status -- the same
"don't leak the volume being replaced" behavior
[`docs/guides/machine-storage-csi.md`](machine-storage-csi.md) describes
in full for Kairon's own driver; it applies identically here.

## Real limits today (first cut)

- **`attachRequired: false` drivers only.** No `ControllerPublishVolume`
  plumbing exists -- a driver that requires a controller-side attach step
  before `NodeStageVolume` will fail. This rules out EBS-CSI, PD-CSI,
  Azure Disk CSI, and most other cloud block-storage drivers.
- **No secrets, ever** (see "Why no secrets" above) -- a driver whose node
  operations require a resolved Secret will fail `NodeStageVolume`/
  `NodePublishVolume` outright. `volumeAttributes` (unauthenticated,
  inline config) is the only way to pass driver-specific config through.
- **Explicit allowlist, not automatic discovery.** A driver not listed in
  `node.thirdPartyCSIDrivers` is refused with a clear error -- there is no
  fallback to kubelet's own `plugins_registry/` discovery.
- **Staging/publish paths are Kairon-synthesized, not kubelet's Pod-UID
  convention.** Built from the Machine's own deterministic `RuntimeName()`
  instead. Most CSI drivers treat these paths as opaque and don't care,
  but a driver that specifically depends on kubelet's own path shape
  (some drivers key internal state off it) is a named, real compatibility
  risk here, not a hidden one.
- **Only validated conceptually, not against a live driver.** The request
  shapes (`NodeStageVolumeRequest`/`NodePublishVolumeRequest` fields, the
  allowlist-fail-closed behavior, idempotency against existing status) have
  real unit test coverage against a fake gRPC CSI server
  (`internal/agent/csi_thirdparty_test.go`), but no live Ceph-CSI/RBD (or
  any other third-party driver) cluster exists in this project's test
  environment to validate end-to-end. Treat this as an opt-in, first-cut
  capability until validated against your own real driver deployment.
- **No raw block mode, no volume expansion, no snapshots** through this
  path -- only `Filesystem`-mode `NodeStageVolume`/`NodePublishVolume`,
  matching every other Kairon boot-disk source. A driver's own
  `ControllerExpandVolume`/snapshot support (if any) isn't wired up here.
- **No health/stats reporting** (`NodeGetVolumeStats` is never called).
- **Read-only host mount, larger container surface.** Enabling this
  mounts the node's entire `/var/lib/kubelet/plugins` directory
  read-only into the `kairon-node` container -- broader than the single
  socket actually dialed, because per-driver dynamic volume mounts from
  an arbitrary operator-configured map aren't templated in this first
  cut. `kairon-node` itself only ever connects to the one socket path
  configured per driver name; nothing in this codebase lists or reads
  anything else under that mount. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/zyvorai/kairon/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
